Letter of Notice

Description:
This formal letter template is specifically tailored to provide a short notice to the addressee. The large heading bar at the top provides a central focus for the letter while the body of the letter is intentionally narrow, centered and in an 11pt font size with increased spacing to restrict the text of the letter to a single sharp message. This template would be most suited to a short formal communication of notice between a client and a business, such as for a notice of inspection, resignation letter or a letter stating intent to move out of a property.
Original Author:
This template was originally created by Rashadul Islam but has been extensively modified for this website.
