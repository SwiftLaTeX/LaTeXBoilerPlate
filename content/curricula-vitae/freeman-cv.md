Freeman Curriculum Vitae

Description
This curriculum vitae template fits a large amount of information in a concise two-column layout without feeling too saturated with information. When your content grows too large, it will be automatically wrapped to the next page, as you can see in the PDF preview. Sections are cleanly delimited and can be easily moved around to highlight the parts of your experience and skills that are most important to the job you are applying for. The template includes a number of example section types which should enable you to find a place for any type of information youâ€™d like to include.
Authors
This template was originally created by Alessandro Plasmati. It has been entirely rewritten for this website by Vel.
