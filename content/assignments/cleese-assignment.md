Cleese Assignment

Description
This template comes in two versions, one for teachers/instructors/educators to create assignments/homework for their students to fill out by hand, and another for students proficient in LaTeX to answer questions posed to them at school or university/college. Both versions contain simple environments for each question and subquestion within, and allow answer boxes to be created with either an answer or blank for space to write an answer. Sets of questions can be grouped by headings and the template includes examples of including an image, table, equation and code within questions.
The students version of the template contains a title page for handing in the assignment and headers on each page list the class, assignment title, class instructor and student name, so if any page gets lost it can be easily attributed to the correct student later. The teachers version of the template does not have a title page as it is meant to be distributed to students individually on paper and lists the class, assignment title, class instructor and due date in the headers on each page.
