a0poster Landscape Poster

Description:
This poster features a clean landscape layout with a large header section housing important information about the poster, a column for contact information and space for a logo of your institution or a photo of you. Poster content is neatly divided into four columns to make use of the space available as much as possible. The number of columns can easily be changed if you would like the extra width for larger tables and figures. The template features the ability to easily change the color of any section or element and shows this off with several examples (e.g. the color of the introduction and conclusions sections). A diversity of colors are available for selection, see here for a full list with examples. Examples of a table, wrapped table, figure, equation, list and bibliography are present in the template to provide a starting point for any requirement you may have for your own poster.
Original Author:
The a0poster class was created by Gerlinde Kettl and Matthias Weiser. This template uses this class but has been created for this website by Vel.
