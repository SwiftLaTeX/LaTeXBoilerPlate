Stylish Article

Description:
This article template attempts to emulate the design of contemporary scientific publications. It does this by including colored boxes behind the abstract and headings and a succinct text layout. The template features a table of contents, something usually not seen in articles, which makes it ideal for longer articles with significant structure or for archival purposes. This table of contents can be removed for a look more suited to journal publication. The template also includes examples of a table, bibliography, equation, lists and figures (full page and in-text).
Original Author:
This template was originally created by Mathias Legrand but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
