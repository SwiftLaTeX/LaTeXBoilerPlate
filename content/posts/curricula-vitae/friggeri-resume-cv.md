Friggeri Resume/CV

Description:
This beautiful Resume/CV template is suitable for anyone, from a designer with many short contracts to a scientist with varied publications. The template features a sidebar for important information such as contact details, languages, skills, titles, etc. The rest of the content is housed in clear colored sections with each entry featuring a space for a date, title, description and location. The publication list in this template is particularly useful for those that wish to list an extensive list of publications within separate categories. Custom publication categories can be specified in the template, for example, for international vs. local conference proceedings. A print mode is available which removes all coloring from the template for printing on a black and white printer.
Important Notes:
This template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX and the bibliography, if used, needs to be compiled with biber rather than bibtex. If you have any compilation issues, please try updating your LaTeX distribution and all packages before asking a question on the forum!
Original Author:
This template was originally created by Adrien Friggeri but has been modified for this website.
