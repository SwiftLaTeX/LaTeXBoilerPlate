Compact Academic CV

Description:
This curriculum vitae/resume template is designed to succinctly display your career information and works particularly well for showcasing academic careers. Academics tend to have many appointments, honours and publications which this template compresses down to single lines to maximise readability and minimise length. The design is minimalist with plenty of whitespace and a central feature of the template is the optional year labels for all entries in the CV. Entries can be easily modified to house multiple lines or further delimited in sub-sections as shown in the publications section.
Original Author:
This curriculum vitae was originally created by Dario Taraborelli but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
