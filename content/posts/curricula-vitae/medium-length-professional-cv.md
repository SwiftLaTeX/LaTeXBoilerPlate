Medium Length Professional

Description:
This curriculum vitae template is clearly structured into sections separated by lines. As is, the template is more conducive to medium-length professional CV’s where work experience dominates the interest of the employer. The template can easily be expanded out to multiple pages but is best kept to at most 2 pages for section clarity.
Important note: The file ‘resume.cls’ is required to be in the same directory as the template because the .tex file uses this custom class for structuring the document.
Original Author:
This curriculum vitae was originally created by Trey Hunner but has been extensively modified for this website.
