Daily Laboratory Book

Description:
This template is useful for those working in a laboratory where records must be kept for academic or commercial purposes. Often times working in the laboratory means scrawling messy notes in a physical book so this template helps to make a laboratory book more organized and digitally searchable. The template features a cover page, hyperlinked table of contents, daily logs of progress made on individual experiments and a formulae and media recipes section. The template is organized in such a way that each day is simple to add to the book.
Please read the commented text at the start of the template to learn how it works.
Important note: The file ‘labbook.cls’ is required to be in the same directory as the template because the .tex file uses this custom style for structuring the lab book. This file is included in the .zip file available for download.
Original Author:
This laboratory book template was originally created by Frank Kuster but has been extensively modified for this website.
