Conference/Event Timetable

Description:
This calendar template is useful for creating a conference/event calendar. Each day can be given a title (such as your location on that day) followed by the plan for that day. The calendar can span any number of weeks and the starting dates can be changed.
Important note: The file ‘calendar.sty’ is required to be in the same directory as the template because the .tex file uses this custom style for structuring the calendar.
Original Author:
The calendar style and template .tex file used to make this calendar were made by Evan Sultanik but the template has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
