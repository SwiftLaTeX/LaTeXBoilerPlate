Monthly Calendar

Description:
This calendar template is useful for creating a calendar month on a single A4 sheet of paper. This can be left blank with just the day numbers or text can be written for individual days. The starting day and date can be readily changed within the template.
LaTeX is not made for easily numbering calendars and automatically adjusting to different needs. This means this template can be a bit finicky but it has been extensively commented to make it as easy as possible to use.
Important note: The file ‘calendar.sty’ is required to be in the same directory as the template because the .tex file uses this custom style for structuring the calendar.
Original Author:
The calendar style used to make this calendar was made by Evan Sultanik but the template file was made by Vel.
