Short Three Column Newsletter

Description:
This newsletter template is best suited to shorter newsletters consisting of short articles from a number of contributors. It features a prominent main news item at the start to provide a space for important updates or a summation of events by a single author. The body of the newsletter has a three-column layout which is conducive to short articles by a number of authors. The newsletter header on the first page clearly displays the newsletter name and edition while the footers on each page provide contact information and a longer description of the newsletter. The template includes examples of displaying pictures both within the three-column layout or as a larger full-page feature. A numbered list and quotation block are also exemplified as these are typical newsletter components.
