Plain Cover Letter

Description:
A plain cover letter template with your name and address at the top in bold. The layout is traditional and is best suited to single-page letters. The format offers plenty of space for a longer cover letter and includes a description of the content that should be written in each paragraph.
Original Author:
This cover letter was originally created by the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute but has been extensively modified for this website.
