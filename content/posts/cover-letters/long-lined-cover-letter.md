Long Lined Cover Letter

Description:
This cover letter template uses the newlfm package and features a clean professional layout which can take a large amount of text per page. The ability to include a company/institution logo at the top of the letter further adds to the professional look. The content of the letter itself is presented between two horizontal lines and contains your contact information, the addressee and letter content. Any element of the letter can be easily removed within the template to customize the layout to your requirements.
Original Author:
This cover letter was originally created by Matthew J. Miller but has been extensively modified for this website.
