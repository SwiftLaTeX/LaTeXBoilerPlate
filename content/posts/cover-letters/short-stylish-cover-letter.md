Short Stylish Cover Letter

Description:
This stylish cover letter includes a custom large header and footer. The ‘To’ address is placed so as to show up in a windowed envelope. Unfortunately these do not leave much space for text but there are several ways of increasing available space described in the template.
Important notes: this template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX. There should be a setting in your LaTeX distribution to change to XeLaTeX. This template also uses two fonts which are not distributed with Windows or Linux by default. These will need to be changed to available fonts for the template to compile.
Original Author:
This cover letter was originally created by kindoblue but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
