Thin Formal Letter

Description:
This formal letter template has a narrow appearance pulling the attention of the reader to the minimal amount of text. The layout is very conservative so as to give an air of formality and ample space is left on the bottom of the letter for a signature. Address fields are provided for both the sender and recipient of the letter. The template also features an example of how to add a postscript (P.S.) and how to list enclosed files.
Authorship:
This template was originally an example created for WikiBooks but was rewritten from scratch for version 2.0 by Vel.
