Diaz Essay

The template is designed for PDFLaTeX.

Description
This essay template is best used for literature essays containing mostly text. This is supported by a thin single column layout with clear unnumbered section titles to increase readability. The template contains an abstract, keywords and references, which makes it suitable for college/university essays but these elements can be easily removed for a simpler high school essay. Further examples of common essay components are included: referencing using a bibliography, an inline figure, a table and lists.
Original Author
This template was originally created by Nicolas Diaz but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
