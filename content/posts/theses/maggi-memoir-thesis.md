Maggi Memoir Thesis

Description:
This template uses the memoir document class to beautifully typeset a thesis. It is suitable for any high-level degree thesis such as for a PhD, Masters or Honors. The layout of the content is in a thin format to promote easy reading and the template features advanced specification of margins and trimming. An example of this is seen in the trimming lines within the preview for this template whereby the stock paper size and the size of the content are independently specified within the template. You can, of course, remove these lines and fit the content to the paper. The thesis boasts a professional look which is immediately obvious from the title page itself and carries through the design of the rest of the document. Three custom fonts are used in the template to match the design and beautifully display your content.
The template includes two chapters, the first is the introduction to the original template author’s thesis and is a useful resource for real examples of text layout. The second is an example chapter which houses practical examples of a number of commonly-used document elements such as figures, tables, code snippets, lists, descriptions, equations, and more. Along with these content chapters, the template includes a bibliography, index, title page, preface, abstract, table of contents/figures/tables/acronyms and a colophon.
Important notes:

This template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX.
By default the template requires the following fonts: Adobe Caslon Pro, Optima Regular and Envy Code R. The first two are included with Apple OSX and the last is freely available online. Windows and Linux users either have to obtain the first two or change those fonts within the template to others. Simply find the Fonts block in thesis.tex and remove/modify the three lines defining those fonts. Alternatively, download the WriteLaTeX version of this template which compiles with pdflatex and uses the default LaTeX font.
The main document file in the zipped template is thesis.tex. Structure.tex is used to specify the document structure and load packages, acronyms.tex specifies acronyms used in the thesis and bibliography.bib contains the bibliography in BibTeX format. The Chapters directory houses the two content chapters and the Figures folder contains all figures used.
To compile the index and bibliography, you will need to run “bibtex” and “makeindex” on main.tex within your LaTeX distribution or from the command line.

This thesis was originally created by Federico Maggi but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
