This template has been designed as a homage to the elements of typographic style. As such, it has an air of efficiency and optimal design. It is suitable for any high-level degree thesis such as for a PhD, Masters or Honors. Sections within the thesis are clearly separated in a consistent way, as are sections within each chapter. The default structure of the thesis proceeds in the following order: title page, dedication, abstract, publications, acknowledgements, contents, list of tables/figures/listings, acronyms, content chapters, appendices, bibliography, colophon and declaration.
The template includes a chapter to get you started using the template and provides several useful suggestions which are worth reading. Also included are two chapters showing the capability of the template to give an idea of how it will look with your content.
Important note: this template comes as a zip file with multiple files and folders within it. It is a good idea to familiarize yourself with each of the included files and to read the introductory chapter so you are well equipped to make use of this template.
