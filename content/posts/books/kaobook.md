Description
This template is designed for writing books and graduate-level theses and provides numerous examples and documentation to enable complex requirements. The design features a relatively narrow main text column with an adjacent wide margin to house notes, figures, tables, citations and captions. The narrow text column facilitates faster reading by reducing horizontal eye movement distance and makes reading less fatiguing. Content can be split into the standard section types of parts, chapters, sections, subsections, subsubsections and paragraphs with examples of all of these provided. Several chapter styles are available depending on your requirements, ranging from text only to including the chapter number to including a full-width background image.
The front matter of the template includes a title page, copyright page, quote/dedication page, preface, table of contents and lists of tables and figures. Each is populated with example content to get you started and can be removed easily if it is not needed. The back matter of the template includes an appendix, bibliography, notation (a.k.a. nomenclature), greek letters example table, glossary and index. These can be moved to the front matter or removed easily and are provided as examples if these features are required.
The template body includes numerous examples of how to make use of the large margin for all kinds of content. The main text column contains examples of coloured boxes, lists, code listings, figures, tables, equations, referencing, theorems and more to serve as a reference to cover every possible use case for your own content. You can simply copy/paste one of the examples from the template when you require it.
The text of the template first expertly describes the logic behind the template and then moves on to an overview of the template structure and how it is split into directories and files. It goes on to document template options and packages used, then provides examples of all the elements discussed above. It’s important to read this information carefully if you are going to write a substantial work using the template, this template is not for LaTeX beginners and requires some LaTeX knowledge to make full use of it.
