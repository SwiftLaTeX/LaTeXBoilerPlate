Formal Book Title Page

Description:
This title page template is best suited to books and formal applications, such as in the fields of science or engineering. It features a formal layout with a clear title highlighted by two horizontal rules. A subtitle is available to further describe the work and multiple authors/editors are catered for towards the centre of the page.
The template compiles as a standalone document to act as a starting point for creating a document but it includes instructions for integrating this title page into an existing document.
Original Author:
This title page was originally created by Peter Wilson but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
