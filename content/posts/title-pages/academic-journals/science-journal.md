Science Journal

Description:
The Science Journal allows authors to submit their manuscripts formatted in LaTeX. For this, they provide a template which contains the structure and reference style they would like for submissions.
The template provided here includes a filled-out example article, the Science bibliography style, example bibliography and the scicite package used for formatting the reference numbers. The template is extensively commented and sectioned to make writing your Science manuscript easy. Also included is information for what document elements you can add to the manuscript and how you should do so, as well as information on what to submit and in what format. More guidelines are available on the Using LaTeX page on the Science website
