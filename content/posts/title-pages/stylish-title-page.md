Stylish Title Page

Description:
This title page template features a large title and subtitle surrounded by two curly brackets to bring focus to the title and add to the stylish design of the template. The author name is centered below the title and publisher information is seen at the bottom. This makes the template best suited to a book or other large work, but it can be easily adapted to any other usage. A diversity of colors are available for selection, see here for a full list with examples.
The template compiles as a standalone document to act as a starting point for creating a document but it includes instructions for integrating this title page into an existing document.
Original Author:
This title page was originally created by Peter Wilson but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
