Academic Title Page

Description:
This title page is useful for academic works such as assignments, reports, theses or books. The headings can be used to neatly display the institute, course or subject matter of the work. It design is clean with the major feature being two horizontal lines highlighting the title. The template contains code for an alternate layout without a supervisor name and for an institution logo at the bottom of the page.
The template compiles as a standalone document but comes with instructions for integrating it into another LaTeX document.
Original Author:
This title page was originally created for WikiBooks but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
