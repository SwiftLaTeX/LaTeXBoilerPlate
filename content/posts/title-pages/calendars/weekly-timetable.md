Weekly Timetable

Description:
This calendar template is useful for creating a weekly calendar of recurring events. Within each day, the time of the event is divided from the event title for easy scheduling. This layout would suit a university student planning their weekly lectures, as shown in the example.
Important note: The file ‘calendar.sty’ is required to be in the same directory as the template because the .tex file uses this custom style for structuring the calendar.
Original Author:
The calendar style used to make this calendar was made by Evan Sultanik but the template file was made by Vel.
