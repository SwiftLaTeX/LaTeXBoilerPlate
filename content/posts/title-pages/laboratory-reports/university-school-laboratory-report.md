University/School Laboratory Report

Description:
This template provides a clean structured format for writing a report based on a laboratory experiment. The structure follows the typical flow of information required in a laboratory report: the objective of the experiment, methods, data gathered, results and discussion. This template would best suit an studentâ€™s write-up of an experiment at a university or school.
Original Author:
This laboratory book template was originally created by the Linux and Unix Users Group at Virginia Tech Wiki but has been extensively modified for this website.
