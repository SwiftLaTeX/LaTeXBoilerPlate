Minimalist Book Title Page

Description:
This title page template is best suited for a book. The minimalistic design immediately highlights the title and the use of red further focuses the eye on the core of what the work is about. The subtitle is neatly tucked away under the title to expand on it and the author/publisher information frames the title. A diversity of colours are available for the title, see here for a full list with examples.
The template compiles as a standalone document to act as a starting point for creating a document but it includes instructions for integrating this title page into an existing document.
Original Author:
This title page was originally created by Peter Wilson but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
