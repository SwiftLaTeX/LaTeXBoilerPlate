Classic Lined Title Page

Description:
This title page template features a classic lined look most suited to a book or other larger work. The title is highlighted with large red all-caps text and a thin rule underneath separates it from the author name and publisher further down the page. For a less intense look, a diversity of colours are available for selection, see here for a full list with examples.
The template compiles as a standalone document to act as a starting point for creating a document but it includes instructions for integrating this title page into an existing document.
Original Author:
This title page was originally created by Peter Wilson but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
