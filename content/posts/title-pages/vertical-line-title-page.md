Vertical Line Title Page

Description:
This title page template features a central vertical line which frames the rest of the text on the page. The title is clearly visible in a large bold font and the design also includes a subtitle, author name and publisher information. The title page would be well suited to a book but it can be used for other applications too.
The template compiles as a standalone document to act as a starting point for creating a document but it includes instructions for integrating this title page into an existing document.
Original Author:
This title page was originally created by Peter Wilson but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
