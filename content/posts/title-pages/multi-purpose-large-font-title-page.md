Multi-Purpose Large Font

Description:
This title page template can be used for almost any document type. The title is displayed in a very large font size in a wide grey box to accentuate the subject matter while your details are shown at the bottom in a small section. The box colour can be changed from grey and the template includes a secondary serif font option.
This template compiles as a standalone document to act as a starting point for creating a document but it includes instructions for integrating the title page into an existing document.
Original Author:
This title page was originally created by Frits Wenneker but has been extensively modified for this website by Vel.
