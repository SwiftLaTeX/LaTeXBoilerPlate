Dictionary

Description:
This template creates a dictionary with a two-column layout and clear headings delimiting different letters. The header on each page contains the first and last word on that page, making for easy navigation. Converting your current dictionary information to use in this template is easy as a single command specifies the addition of each word. By default, this line has four arguments for the: word, pronunciation, classification and definition. Each can be customized as required (e.g. bold, italic, sans-serif, etc) or other arguments can be added. When you want to add your own content in bulk, simply write a regular expression to split it into these arguments and copy it into the template.
Original Author:
This template was created by Vel, inspired by a template by Marc Lavaud.
