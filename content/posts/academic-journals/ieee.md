Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

Description:
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) allows authors to submit their publications formatted in LaTeX to any of their 100+ transactions journals except for IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation. For this, they provide the IEEEtran class and demo templates which contain the structure and reference style they would like for submissions. The IEEE Photonics Society also provides the IEEEphot class and a demo template for submissions to IEEE Photonics.
Six templates are provided here for different subsets of IEEE publications:

Advanced Demo for Computer Society Journals
Standard Demo for Computer Society Journals
Demo for Conference Papers
Demo for Journal Papers
Demo for Transactions on Magnetics
Demo for IEEE Photonics

All six templates come with the relevant class file, the template as a tex file, a readme for contact/legal information, a change log and a how-to PDF with detailed instructions for how to use the template and class. The templates are heavily commented and there is plenty of additional information in the how-to document and on the IEEE website. Each template includes examples of how to properly section the document, include references and citations, include relevant meta-data, include a biography, include appendices and more.
More information on submitting to IEEE transactions journals can be found here and to IEEE Photonics here.
