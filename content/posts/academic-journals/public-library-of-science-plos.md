Public Library of Science (PLOS)

Description:
The Public Library of Science (PLOS) allows authors to submit their manuscript formatted in LaTeX to any of their journals. For this, they provide a template which contains the structure and reference style they would like for submissions. Journals published by PLOS include: PLOS ONE, PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Genetics, PLOS Pathogens, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases and PLOS Currents. 
The PLOS LaTeX template features an intentionally simple layout to make review easy and PLOS explicitly state that template elements should not be modified or removed. Upon initial submission, you are requested to submit the PDF of your manuscript containing the text, references, figure legends and tables. Figures are submitted separately as .TIFF or .EPS files only. If the article is accepted, you will be asked to provide the .tex and .bib files for validation. PLOS have a number of guidelines for using their template with regard to formatting which you should take care to read here.
Copyright Owner:
The template provided here was created and is owned by PLOS. LaTeX Templates cannot change the template in any way due to copyright restrictions and files provided here are unmodified from their original source at PLOS.
