American Geophysical Union

Description
The American Geophysical Union (AGU) allows authors to submit their manuscript formatted in LaTeX to any of their journals. For this, they provide a template which contains the structure and reference style they would like for submissions. The template contains two tex files, one for the article and another for supporting information.
The AGU LaTeX template features a single-column draft layout by default. The template contains ample commenting which advises you how the AGU would like you to use the template. It is strongly recommended you read the comments throughout the template to ensure a speedy submission process. For more guidelines please see the LaTeX Guidelines page at the AGU website.
The AGU publishes the following journals:
AGU Advances; GeoHealth; Earth and Space Science; Earthâ€™s Future; Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems; Geophysical Research Letters; Global Biogeochemical Cycles; Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES); Journal of Geophysical Research; Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology; Radio Science; Reviews of Geophysics; Space Weather; Tectonics; Water Resources Research.
