American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)

Description:
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) allows authors to submit their manuscripts formatted in LaTeX to any of their journals and conferences. For this, they provide three templates which contain the structure and referencing style they would like for submissions. If you are submitting a journal article for initial review, you should use the two-column journal template; if your journal article has been accepted then you should use the one-column journal template for production purposes. If you are submitting to an ASME conference, use the conference template.
The templates provided here include instructions for how to use them and examples of all the common elements that are required in journal/conference submissions.  The templates are extensively commented and sectioned to make writing your manuscript easy. Make sure to read the text in the template as this contains important information for the way in which you should fill out the template.
The ACM currently publishes the following journals:
Applied Mechanics Reviews, ASCE-ASME Journal of Risk and Uncertainty in Engineering Systems, ASME Journal of Engineering and Science in Medical Diagnostics and Therapy, Part B: Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mechanics, Biomechanical Engineering, Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, Computing and Information Science in Engineering, Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control, Electronic Packaging, Electrochemical Energy Conversion and Storage, Energy Resources Technology, Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, Engineering Materials and Technology, Fluids Engineering, Fuel Cell Science and Technology, Heat Transfer, Manufacturing Science and Engineering, Mechanical Design, Mechanisms and Robotics, Medical Devices, Micro and Nano-Manufacturing, Nanotechnology in Engineering and Medicine, Nondestructive Evaluation, Diagnostics and Prognostics of Engineering Systems, Nuclear Engineering and Radiation Science, Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering, Pressure Vessel Technology, Solar Energy Engineering: Including Wind Energy and Building Energy Conservation, Thermal Science and Engineering Applications, Tribology, Turbomachinery, Verification, Validation and Uncertainty Quantification, Vibration and Acoustics.
