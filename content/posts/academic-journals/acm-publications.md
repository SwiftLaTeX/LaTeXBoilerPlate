Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)

Description:
The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) allows authors to submit their manuscripts formatted in LaTeX to any of their journals. For this, they provide templates which contain the structure and referencing style they would like for submissions. For the vast majority of ACM journals, you should use the Small Standard Format Template, however, a few require one of the other templates, so find the journal you are submitting to in the list below to identify the template you should use.
The templates provided here include a filled-out example article template, a guide for correctly using the template, the ACM bibliography style, example bibliography and an ACM class used for formatting the article. The template is extensively commented and sectioned to make writing your manuscript easy. Make sure to read the included guide as this contains important information for the way in which you should fill out the template.
The ACM currently publishes a large number of journals. Below is a list of these journals divided by the template that you should use for each:
Small Standard Format: ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), Journal of Data and Information Quality (JDIQ), Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA), Journal of the ACM (JACM), ACM Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing (TALLIP), Journal on Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems (JETC), Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS), Transactions on Algorithms (TALG), Transactions on Architecture and Code Optimization (TACO), Transactions on Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP), Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS), Transactions on Computation Theory (TOCT), Transactions on Computational Logic (TOCL), Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI), Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE), Transactions on Database Systems (TODS), Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES), Transactions on Economics and Computation (TEAC), Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS), Transactions on Information and System Security (TISSEC), Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS), Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT), Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data (TKDD), Transactions on Management Information Systems (TMIS), Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS), Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS), Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Applications (TOMM), Transactions on Parallel Computing (TOPC), Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS), Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN), Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM), Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems (TSAS), Transactions on Speech and Language Processing (TSLP), Transactions on Storage (TOS), Transactions on the Web (TWEB), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing (TASLP), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (TCBB), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON), ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems (TCPS), ACM Transactions on Human-Robot Interaction (THRI), ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computing Systems (TOMPECS), ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security (TOPS), ACM Transactions on Social Computing (TSC)
Large 1-Column Format: Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage (JOCCH), Transactions on Applied Perception (TAP), Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT)
Large 2-Column Format: Transactions on Graphics (TOG)
Proceedings Format: Most proceedings authors will use the “sigconf” proceedings template. If you are unsure which template variant to use, please request clarification from your event or publication contact.
