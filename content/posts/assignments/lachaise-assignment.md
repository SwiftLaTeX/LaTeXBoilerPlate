Lachaise Assignment

Description
This template is for teachers/instructors/educators to create assignments/homework for their students. It includes a clear title on the first page for the course, assignment and teacher’s name, as well as the institution and date. Sets of questions can be grouped by headings and the template includes examples of unnumbered and numbered sections, and numbered subsections (for longer assignments).
Amongst the description text for each question, examples are provided for virtually any subject matter, including: equations, algorithms, code and command line outputs. Questions to students are clearly presented in question boxes with optional titles, and these can be in paragraph form or multi-choice, as shown in the template. Specific elements that students should pay particular attention to can be housed in either warning or information blocks delimited with a bold line on the left to draw attention.
