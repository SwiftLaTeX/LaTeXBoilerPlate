Professional Table

Description:
This table template provides a quick reference for how to add professional-looking tables to any document. The booktabs package is utilized to enable the use of horizontal rules specific for different parts of the table, adding to the overall professional aesthetic of the table. The table includes examples of amalgamating multiple columns into one cell and creating horizontal rules which do not span the entire width of the table. The entire table is extensively commented with further customization options and explanations for each line.
