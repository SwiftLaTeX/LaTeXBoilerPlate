Invoice

Description:
This invoice template allows a small business or individual to produce invoices for goods and services. It features a clear header including the company providing the invoice followed by the recipient’s information. The list of goods and services being charged for is clear and concise separated by individual days and categories. The ability to include one-off expenses (without an hourly rate) is also present. The template is very simple to fill out; for each line a date, the number of hours worked and the hourly rate are specified and the template does all the calculations to produce the subtotal and total.
Important note: The file ‘invoice.cls’ is required to be in the same directory as the template because the .tex file uses this custom class for structuring the document.
Original Author:
This invoice template was originally created by Trey Hunner but has been extensively modified for this website.
