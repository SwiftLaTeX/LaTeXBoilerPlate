Description:
This template typesets your poetry in a beautiful and simple way using the ‘verse’ LaTeX package and a number of custom commands. The template is designed for you to quickly typeset poetry without worrying about complex indentation and positioning. Most of the functionality of the package is included in the template including: automatic poem positioning based on average verse length, custom title/author commands, line numbering, every second line indentation, indentation patterns and manual indentation. The template is highly structured and commented for you to immediately see how each of these elements is to be used.
