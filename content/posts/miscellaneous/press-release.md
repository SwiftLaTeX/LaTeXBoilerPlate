Press Release

Description:
A press release is a written statement to the media. Press releases are used to announce news, products, services, events, awards, etc. Writing a descriptive press release is a crucial requirement of PR and communication work. This template makes writing a press release easy by dividing the document into the necessary sections and elements that are required for a clear press release. At the top of the press release is a place for a logo for your company/institution which serves to give the release credibility and recognition. Underneath this is a section for contact information regarding the release along with the date of the release. Next is the headline and subtitle which need to grab attention and provide enough detail to make the purpose of the release clear at a glance. Finally, the content of the press release starts with a location, date and summary of the content followed by the body of the release. The template includes a short descriptive guide as to the structure of a press release which acts as a guide for writing your own.
