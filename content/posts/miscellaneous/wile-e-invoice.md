Wile E. Invoice

Description
This invoice template is for businesses or contractors who need to request payments from customers or clients. It features a clean simple layout with a company name at the top, then a section for the recipient’s contact information, then a section for invoice information, then the invoice items, then a terms and conditions and amount due section and finally a sender’s contact information section. The invoice is created using a series of custom commands that make populating all the information very easy. All invoice numbers for subtotals, gross, tax and net are calculated automatically using a provided tax rate and item quantities and rates.
Authors
This template was created by Peter Morrison-Whittle and Vel.
