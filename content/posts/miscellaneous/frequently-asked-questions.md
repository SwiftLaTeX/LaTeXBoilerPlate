Frequently Asked Questions

Description:
This template provides an easy framework for creating a frequently asked questions (FAQâ€™s) document. The first page features a large title followed by a subtitle and list of all questions. Questions are clearly displayed in colored boxes with answers after them in plain text. Each question can contain a unique label to allow referencing it in future questions via links. Questions are also automatically numbered and this number can be referred to at any point.
