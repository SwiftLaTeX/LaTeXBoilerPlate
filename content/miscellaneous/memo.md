Memo

Description:
A memo (formal name memorandum) is a business document used for communication within a company or between two companies. Their purpose is to convey information in a relatively short but formal document which can be sent out to a number of relevant people. This template uses the texMemo class to make writing a memo using LaTeX incredibly simple. The template includes the ability to include a company logo underneath which the memo information is housed. The layout of the document is professional and the use of the Palatino font gives it a unique touch to differentiate your memos from those produced by other means!
Original Author:
The texMemo class used in this template was created by Rob Oakes.
