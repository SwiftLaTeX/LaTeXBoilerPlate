Conference Booklet

Description
This template is for conference organisers who wish to produce a booklet or online document for attendees detailing conference information and presenters. The template is primarily aimed at academic conferences but can be tailored to commercial conferences.
The template is structured to initially display a cover page (from image) then the main conference information. A daily timetable follows and breaks down each day into conference events, breaks and talks. Four talk types are available and special ones are highlighted in the timetable. A full list of abstracts follows and displays information about each talk including authors, affiliations and examples of including references. Posters can be output in the same style of abstracts, or alternatively as a compact list with just titles, authors and affiliations. A list of participants is available and can be used to list all attendees of the conference as a quick reference. Finally, housekeeping information and sponsors are listed at the end.
