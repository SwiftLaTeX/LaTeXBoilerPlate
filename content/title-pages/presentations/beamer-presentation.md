Beamer Presentation

Description:
This presentation template uses the well-known Beamer class and shows how effortless presentation-making with LaTeX can be. The template has examples of most of the features that are typically found in a presentation, including the following example slides: title, overview, paragraphs of text, bullet points, blocks of highlighted text, multiple columns, tables, theorems, verbatim text, figures, citations, references and conclusions/acknowledgments. Examples of how to use sections and subsections show how a presentation can be broken down into distinct pieces for automatic inclusion on the overview slide. A list of Beamer themes and color profiles is also included in the template to allow customization of the presentationâ€™s appearance.
