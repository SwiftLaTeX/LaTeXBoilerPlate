      <description>Arsclassica Article Description: This article uses the Arsclassica package (a modification of the Classic Thesis package) to specify the document layout and structure. The template features a single column layout which makes it suitable for a greater number of applications such as for academic articles, business articles and reports. The page layout is very clean and minimal to focus on the content at hand in an elegant way. Examples of virtually all typical article constituents are included: references, mathematics, lists, figures, tables, sections and theorems.</description>

      <description>Stylish Article Description: This article template attempts to emulate the design of contemporary scientific publications. It does this by including colored boxes behind the abstract and headings and a succinct text layout. The template features a table of contents, something usually not seen in articles, which makes it ideal for longer articles with significant structure or for archival purposes. This table of contents can be removed for a look more suited to journal publication.</description>
