      <description>The Legrand Orange Book Description: This book template features an elegant layout with a beautiful title page and part/chapter headings. The book itself is highly structured into parts, chapters, sections and then subsections. Each is numbered and these numbers are prominently displayed in the left margin where each begins as well as in page headers. Sections and subsections also appear as mini tables of contents on pages separating parts of the book to provide an outline of the content to come.</description>
